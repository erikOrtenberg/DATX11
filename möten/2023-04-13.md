# Status

* Should work on finishing up as we are in the mid of April.

* We have gotten memory operations to work so we can now run both mem and arithmetic ops

* Testbench is a little verbose. Can use macros to make tests easier and not have to assign signals as bitvectors

# What we have to do

* For closing the project we can synthesise and simulate the entire VPU and hopefully deploy to FPGA. Construct algorithm and run tests.

* We apparently should not use int8, instead Mateo rather we use int32? Widen to int16 before computation since multiplication easily overflows

* Eventually we should make our MACC a MACC with widening. e.g making the output int16 for an input of int8.

* Test DMA and GP together.

# Report

* Johannes has worked alot, put in TODOs and fixed disposition.

* Meeting with librarian

* We should have big chapter about architecture and a smaller one about implementation. Keep method and design; and we have architecture.

* Implementation can be moved to design then rename to architecture

* Software as separete header

* Methodology doesn't exist in CSE.

# Goals for next week

## VPU 

Have a synthesizeable design. Maybe deploy to FPGA.

## Memory

Make DMA and GP work together. Allow writing of 64bit numbers (DMA only allows writing of 32bit)
