## Background
Write about about energy efficieny and some kind of scaling.

Make a short introduction and make the background a bit more technical.

## Objective
instead of talking about training time it should be reduction in time of ML workloads.

Don't get to wrapped up in the technicalities so as to not lock ourselves in.

Could make bullet points in objective that just lists our goals.

Make concrete points of what we are going to do but should not be super specific.

## Problem
~~Move the information from problem to background and have the more discussiony parts in problem. ~~

~~SAs are not future proof but VPUs are more flexible as you can give it other instructions. ~~

~~Move 'Comparison with baseline' to 'Methodology'.~~

~~Move certain parts of 'Software' to 'Methodology', where we disicuss what we are going to do.~~

## Scope
If we are constrained to the size of the FPGA we can make a saclable version and implement a small one on FPGA and simulate a larger one.

Specify what we will not do due to existing constraints.

## Methodology

~~Specify somewhere that we decided to make a VPU or make deciding part of the project.~~

Could be possible to develop in C?

~~Could pu comparison to baseline in a subsection here ~~

## Ethics

By focusing on energy efficiency we can enter the field of environmental ethics where regardless of how people would use this tool it would have a positive effect as it would save electricity.

## Time plan
Add a Gantt diagram

Add hardware and software parts to demonstrate that things can be developed in parallel.

Make a mock VPU for the hardware communication folk to develop toward and also work on the real VPU in parallel.

Reencode the weeks to mortal weeks

Write what parts of the methodology will take place when
