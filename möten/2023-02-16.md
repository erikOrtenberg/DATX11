# Notes from meeting about project plan feedback

Fix comments on project plan

revise the time plan. Mateo is away at exam week and we should unload work from there anyway because exams.

Priority 1 for implementing VPU is Store/Load and FMA (Fused-Multiply-Accumulate). This is the bare minimum for a functioning VPU

The FPGA board has linux on its CPU. Using ssh is propably the simplest way to work with it

## What to do for next week

Put some stuff in the actual report for the library thing next week.

Figure out what components need to be constructed for the VPU

Figure out how to get the Vivado bitstream to flow to the FPGA? (might have gotten this wrong)
