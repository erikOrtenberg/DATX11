# Meeting notes for meeting with mateo:

Fredrik, Sofia and Adam present


# Regarding the half time presentation

Mention that Dennard scaling ends because we cannot decrease the voltage anymore 

The intro shouldve been shorter.

There is a chalmers template for slides (Fredrik has it), templates can be found at chalmers internet.

Why did we not show the block diagram of the vpu?

Dont undersell the product. We were too honest. The things you present should be at least what you plan to do or more. Try to sell the product

small terminology:
 - use "hardware architecture"
 - vpu will be used for "vectorized applications"
 - you "implement" or "deploy" to an fpga.

# General stuff:

We should redistribute and have 2 people work on memory, and maybe one on top level stuff. (5 is too many to be working on the lane). 

Maybe someone look into interaction with cpu?

Sofia and Koko work on memory (one of us do axi one of us do memory unit)

Top level stuff should be kept as simple as possible. 

We should be focusing on making things work only.
