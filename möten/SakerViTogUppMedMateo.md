## In second paragraph of 2.3 Machine Learning

"In other words, AI/ML is replacing traditional analytical / mathematical models" -- second 2.3 Machine Learning

Answer: Word it like Mateo, the terminology is weird.

## last paragraph of 2.3 Machine Learning

"...power to create and use": Discontinuity apparently 

Answer: Generating is coding a model, training a model is where the numerical modificatiion happens.

## second paragraph of 2.4.2 Vector processing

"Alternatively, vector processing can be achieved by utilizing several ALUs..." Not an alternative discussed with mateo

Answer: Need not choose one. Can have both.

## 3.1 Scope

What does he mean by high level and what should we do about this? 

Answer: Scope is about what we plan NOT to do. Like we will not be using a real RISC-V core.

matrix mul under machine Learning. the pseudocode

## 4.1 Architectural Overview

Something

## 7.3 Further development

Conflict about what this chapter means.

use the interpretation mateo has






there is a tool for glossary? which manages acronyms? or wordlist words?

add results chapter.

add synthesis results to results. Power consumption and area?

if we cant run the vpu on fpga. somehow derive the python overhead and Gops from having python send 10000 adds to the vpu.
